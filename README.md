# MPTCP Upstream Virtme Docker

This repo contains files to build a vitual environment with virtme to validate
[mptcp_net-next](https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp_net-next) repo.

The idea here is to have automatic builds to published a docker that can be used
by devs and CI.

## Entrypoint options

When launching the docker image, you have to specify the mode you want to use:

- `manual-normal`: This will compile a kernel without a debug config and leave
  you with a shell prompt.
- `manual-debug`: Same but with a kernel debug config.
- `auto-normal`: All the automatic tests are ran in a kernel without a debug
  config.
- `auto-debug`: Same but with a kernel debug config.
- `auto-all`: Same but both non-debug and debug config are used.
- `make`: run the make command with optional parameters.
- `make.cross`: run Intel's make.cross command with optional parameters.
- `cmd`: run the given command.
- `src`: source a given script file.
- `help`: display all possible commands.

All the `manual-*` and `auto-*` options accept optional arguments for
`scripts/config` script from the kernel source code, e.g. `-e DEBUG_LOCKDEP`

## How to use

### User mode

Without cloning this repo, you can quickly get a ready to use environment:

```bash
cd <kernel source code>
docker run -v "${PWD}:${PWD}:rw" -w "${PWD}" --privileged --rm -it \
  --pull always mptcp/mptcp-upstream-virtme-docker:latest \
  <entrypoint options, see above>
```

This docker image needs to be executed with `--privileged` option to be able to
execute QEmu with KVM acceleration.

### Developer mode

Clone this repo, then:

```bash
cd <kernel source code>
/PATH/TO/THIS/REPO/run-tests-dev.sh <entrypoint options, see above>
```

This will build and start the docker image.

## Extension

### Files

3 files can be created in the root dir of the kernel source code:

- `.virtme-exec-pre`
- `.virtme-exec-run`
- `.virtme-exec-post`

`pre` and `post` are ran before and after the tests suite. `run` is ran instead
of the tests suite.

These scripts are sourced and can used functions from the virtme script.

### Env vars

#### Skip kernel build

If you didn't change the kernel code, it can be useful to skip the compilation
part. You can then set `INPUT_BUILD_SKIP=1` to save a few seconds to start the
VM.

#### Not blocking with questions

You can set `INPUT_NO_BLOCK=1` env var not to block if these files are present.
This is useful if you need to do a `git bisect`.

### Not stop after an error is detected with `run_loop`

You can set `INPUT_RUN_LOOP_CONTINUE=1` env var to continue even if an error is
detected. Failed iterations are loggued in `${CONCLUSION}.failed`.

#### Packetdrill

You can set `INPUT_PACKETDRILL_STABLE=1` env var to use the branch for the
current kernel version instead of the dev version following MPTCP net-next.

You can set `INPUT_PACKETDRILL_NO_SYNC=1` env var not to sync Packetdrill with
upstream. This is useful if you mount a local packetdrill repo in the image.

You can also set `INPUT_PACKETDRILL_NO_MORE_TOLERANCE=1` not to increase
Packetdrill's tolerances.

If you run the Docker commands directly, you can use:

```bash
docker run \
  -e INPUT_PACKETDRILL_NO_SYNC=1 \
  -e INPUT_PACKETDRILL_NO_MORE_TOLERANCE=1 \
  -v /PATH/TO/packetdrill:/opt/packetdrill:rw \
  -v "${PWD}:${PWD}:rw" -w "${PWD}" \
  --privileged --rm -it \
  mptcp/mptcp-upstream-virtme-docker:latest \
  manual

cd /opt/packetdrill/gtests/net/
./packetdrill/run_all.py -lv mptcp/dss ## or any other subdirs

# or
cd /opt/packetdrill/gtests/net/mptcp/dss/ ## or any other subdirs
../../packetdrill/packetdrill -v dss_fin_server.pkt ## or any other tests
```

If you use the `run*.sh` scripts, you can set `VIRTME_PACKETDRILL_PATH` to do
this mount and set the proper env var.

```bash
VIRTME_PACKETDRILL_PATH=/PATH/TO/packetdrill \
  /PATH/TO/THIS/REPO/run-tests-dev.sh <entrypoint options, see above>
```

If packetdrill itself is modified and to continue to use the same build
environment, the recompilation can also be done from the running docker image:

```bash
docker exec -w /opt/packetdrill/gtests/net/packetdrill -it \
  $(docker ps --filter ancestor=mptcp/mptcp-upstream-virtme-docker --format='{{.ID}}') \
    make
```
